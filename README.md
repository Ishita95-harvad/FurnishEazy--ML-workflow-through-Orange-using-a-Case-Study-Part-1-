### Overview

FurnishEazy is an exploration of machine learning workflows using Orange, a powerful visual programming tool for data science. This case study demonstrates how to leverage Orange for data preprocessing, visualization, and model building, making machine learning more accessible and intuitive.

### Features

- Drag-and-Drop Interface: Simplifies ML workflow creation.
- Preprocessing Tools: Data cleaning, feature selection, and transformation.
- Visualization: Interactive plots and insights for better model understanding.
- Classification & Regression: Applying ML algorithms with minimal coding.
- Evaluation Metrics: Assess model performance in an easy-to-understand format.
- 
### Installation

To set up Orange and start working on the ML workflow:
- Download and install Orange.
- Install additional required Python packages (if needed).
- Open Orange and load the dataset used in this case study.

### Dataset
The case study uses a structured dataset containing various features related to furniture products, customer preferences, and purchasing behavior.

### Workflow

- Load Data: Import dataset into Orange.
- Preprocessing: Handle missing values, normalize data, and apply feature selection.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize key insights.
- Model Building: Apply different ML algorithms.
- Performance Evaluation: Compare models and refine the approach.
Next Steps
This is Part-1 of the case study. Future sections will dive deeper into model tuning, advanced feature engineering, and real-world deployment strategies.
